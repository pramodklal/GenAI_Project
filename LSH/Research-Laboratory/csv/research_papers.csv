RP-2024-001,"Novel β-Amyloid Oligomer Inhibitors: Structure-Activity Relationship of Substituted Diphenyl Pyrrolidines","Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is characterized by accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We designed and synthesized a series of diphenyl pyrrolidine derivatives targeting Aβ oligomerization. Compound Neuroclear-28 demonstrated potent inhibition of Aβ oligomer formation (IC50=2.3 nM) with excellent blood-brain barrier permeability (Log BB=0.82). In APP/PS1 transgenic mice, Neuroclear-28 reduced cortical Aβ plaque burden by 67% and improved Morris water maze performance. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed critical hydrogen bonding interactions between the fluorophenyl urea moiety and Aβ His13/His14 residues. Neuroclear-28 represents a promising therapeutic candidate for disease-modifying treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Martinez EA, Chen J, Patel R, Thompson KL, Wilson DS, Anderson M","Nature Medicine",2024-03-15,30(3),445-458,10.1038/s41591-024-02891-x,38234567,"Alzheimer's disease; beta-amyloid oligomers; neurodegeneration; drug design; diphenyl pyrrolidines; blood-brain barrier; APP/PS1 mice",127,87.2,Neuroscience | Drug Discovery,"In vitro Aβ aggregation assays, Surface plasmon resonance, Transgenic mouse models, Morris water maze, Immunohistochemistry, Pharmacokinetic profiling","Neuroclear-28 inhibits Aβ oligomerization with IC50=2.3 nM; Reduces plaque burden 67% in vivo; Improves cognitive function in AD mouse model; BBB permeability Log BB=0.82; Well-tolerated in preclinical safety studies",Neuroclear-28 | Donepezil | Memantine,PROJ-I9J0K1L2,"NIH R01 AG078234, Alzheimer's Foundation Grant",TRUE,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-02891-x,text-embedding-3-small,2024-03-15T10:00:00Z
RP-2024-002,"Phase III Clinical Trial Results: Efficacy and Safety of Neuroclear-28 in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's Disease","Background: Neuroclear-28, a novel β-amyloid oligomer inhibitor, has shown promising results in Phase II trials. Methods: This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial (NCT05234567) enrolled 1,847 patients with mild to moderate AD (MMSE 16-26). Patients received Neuroclear-28 50mg BID or placebo for 18 months. Primary endpoint was change in ADAS-Cog13. Results: Neuroclear-28 demonstrated significant improvement in ADAS-Cog13 compared to placebo (difference: -3.2 points, p<0.001). Secondary endpoints showed improvement in ADCS-ADL (p=0.003) and CDR-SB (p=0.012). CSF biomarkers revealed 42% reduction in Aβ42/40 ratio.

RP-2024-003,"Taxane Resistance Mechanisms in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Role of β-Tubulin Isotype Switching and Therapeutic Implications","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) frequently develops resistance to taxane-based chemotherapy, limiting treatment options. We investigated resistance mechanisms in paclitaxel-resistant TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of β-tubulin isotype III (TUBB3) and downregulation of TUBB1 in resistant cells. Proteomic studies confirmed increased βIII-tubulin protein expression (6.8-fold, p<0.001). Resistant cells exhibited altered microtubule dynamics with increased catastrophe frequency. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of TUBB3 restored paclitaxel sensitivity (IC50 decreased from 245 nM to 12 nM). Patient tumor samples showed correlation between TUBB3 expression and poor response to taxane therapy (HR=2.4, p=0.003). Combination treatment with TUBB3 inhibitor TTI-101 and paclitaxel synergistically inhibited resistant tumor growth in vivo (TGI=78%). These findings identify β-tubulin isotype switching as a key resistance mechanism and suggest combination therapy strategies.","Chen M, Zhang L, Kumar V, Williams JR, Brown EK, Davis NH","Cancer Research",2024-04-12,84(8),1456-1472,10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-3456,38456789,"triple-negative breast cancer; paclitaxel resistance; beta-tubulin; microtubules; drug resistance; TUBB3; targeted therapy",89,11.2,Oncology | Cancer Biology,"Cell line models, Patient-derived xenografts, RNA-seq, Proteomics, CRISPR-Cas9, Microtubule dynamics assays, In vivo efficacy studies","TUBB3 upregulation (6.8-fold) drives taxane resistance; CRISPR knockout restores sensitivity (IC50 245→12 nM); Patient correlation: high TUBB3 predicts poor response (HR=2.4); Combination with TTI-101 achieves 78% tumor growth inhibition; Novel therapeutic strategy identified",Paclitaxel | Docetaxel | TTI-101,COMP-ONC-045,"NCI R01 CA234567, Breast Cancer Research Foundation",TRUE,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-23-3456,text-embedding-3-small,2024-04-12T11:00:00Z
RP-2024-004,"Metformin and Longevity: Large-Scale Population Study Reveals 15% Reduction in All-Cause Mortality in Diabetic Cohort","Objective: Evaluate long-term effects of metformin on mortality and age-related diseases. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 143,892 type 2 diabetes patients from UK Biobank database (2006-2023). Propensity score matching compared metformin users (n=78,234) vs. non-users (n=65,658). Mean follow-up: 14.2 years. Results: Metformin use associated with 15% reduction in all-cause mortality (HR=0.85, 95% CI: 0.81-0.89, p<0.0001). Cardiovascular mortality reduced 22% (HR=0.78, p<0.001). Cancer incidence decreased 12% (HR=0.88, p=0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed greater benefit in patients with BMI>30 (HR=0.79) and those starting therapy before age 60 (HR=0.82). Metformin users showed lower incidence of dementia (HR=0.89, p=0.018) and frailty (OR=0.76, p<0.001).

We characterized oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strains isolated during 2023-2024 flu season (n=287 isolates, 34 countries).

Crystal structure of H275Y-mutant NA complexed with oseltamivir revealed disrupted hydrogen bonding with Glu276 and conformational changes in the 150-loop. Zanamivir retained activity against resistant strains (IC50=3.8 nM). Molecular dynamics simulations predicted binding affinity patterns consistent with experimental data. Patient outcomes analysis showed increased viral shedding duration (9.2 vs 4.1 days, p<0.001) and higher ICU admission rates (23% vs 8%, p=0.002) in resistant infections.

We performed comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate CV outcomes. Methods: Systematic review of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane databases (inception-2024). Included 43 RCTs (n=87,234 patients) comparing DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin) vs placebo/active controls. Primary outcome: MACE (CV death, MI, stroke). Results: DPP-4 inhibitors showed neutral effect on MACE (RR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.94-1.05, I²=12%). No significant impact on individual endpoints: CV death (RR=1.02), MI (RR=0.97), stroke (RR=0.98).

We sought to identify predictive biomarkers. Methods: Prospective study of 456 advanced HCC patients receiving sorafenib 400mg BID.

RP-2024-009,"Statin Pleiotropic Effects Beyond Lipid Lowering: Mechanisms and Clinical Implications","Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) exhibit pleiotropic effects independent of cholesterol reduction. We review molecular mechanisms underlying these benefits. Statins inhibit isoprenoid synthesis, affecting Rho GTPase prenylation and downstream signaling. This modulates endothelial function via increased eNOS expression and NO bioavailability. Anti-inflammatory effects include reduced C-reactive protein (30-40% reduction), decreased NF-κB activation, and stabilized atherosclerotic plaques. Atorvastatin demonstrates potent anti-inflammatory activity (IC50=8 nM HMG-CoA reductase). Immunomodulatory properties involve Th1/Th2 balance shift and regulatory T-cell promotion. Antithrombotic effects result from decreased tissue factor expression and enhanced fibrinolysis. Neuroprotective mechanisms include Aβ reduction, anti-oxidant effects, and improved cerebral blood flow. Clinical evidence: JUPITER trial showed 44% reduction in first CV events despite normal LDL-C. Meta-analyses demonstrate reduced stroke risk (RR=0.79), improved outcomes in sepsis (RR=0.61 mortality), and potential benefits in Alzheimer's disease. Bone health effects remain controversial.
