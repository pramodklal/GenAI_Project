PUB-2024-001,"Dual Checkpoint Inhibition with Tumorblocker-9X Demonstrates Superior Anti-Tumor Activity in Advanced Melanoma","Kim SY Martinez JL Rodriguez MJ Chen WH Watson EM",Nature Medicine,2024-11-15,30,11,2456-2468,10.1038/s41591-024-03289-1,39847621,"Background: Dual checkpoint blockade targeting PD-L1 and LAG-3 represents a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. We evaluated Tumorblocker-9X a novel bispecific antibody in patients with advanced melanoma. Methods: Phase 1 dose-escalation study enrolled 78 patients with metastatic melanoma who progressed on prior anti-PD-1 therapy. Primary endpoints were safety and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate and duration of response. Results: MTD was established at 480mg Q3W. ORR was 31% (24/78 patients) with median DOR of 11.2 months. Most common AEs were rash (23%) pruritus (18%) and fatigue (15%). Grade 3-4 immune-related AEs occurred in 9% of patients. Tumorblocker-9X demonstrated higher LAG-3 binding affinity (KD=0.8nM) compared to existing agents. Conclusion: Tumorblocker-9X shows promising efficacy and manageable safety profile warranting Phase 2 evaluation.","Checkpoint inhibitors, PD-L1, LAG-3, Melanoma, Immunotherapy, Bispecific antibody",Oncology,Original Research,87.2,12,Yes,https://nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03289-1.pdf,COMP-ONC-045,COMP-ONC-045,"NIH NCI Grant R01CA245789, ImmunoOnc Pharma",Stanford University School of Medicine,Dr. Susan Kim (skim@stanford.edu),2024-11-15T10:00:00Z
